## What is the idea behind Inspector Budget?

According to Charles Duhigg's bestseller "The Power of Habit", our brains, in attempt to save space and effort, try to transform our daily activities into habits by making it execute them in three steps. The author calls this process “The habit loop”.  The Cue is the first element, the one that triggers the habit. The next one is The routine, the process that we go through in order to achieve our goal. The Reward is the last element of the process, the reason why we began the activity in the first place.
As soon as we are able to define what triggers us to do something and what we expect from this action, we are able to change the routine that leads us to it.

## How does Inspector Budget work?

The game operate as a tool that will assist you to set a habit of controlling the amount and way you spend your money. By logging your outlays, you will be able to keep even those almost insignificant costs always on track, avoiding mysterious holes on your budget and unpleasant surprises on the end of every month.
